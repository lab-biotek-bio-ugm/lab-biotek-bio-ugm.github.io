abstract: 'Microalgae use photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy,
  such as lipid and they can be a replacement for oil-based fuels. They are among
  the fastest growing plants in the world, and about 50% of their weight is oil. This
  lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel. Unfortunately, there are only some of potential
  strains isolated from Indonesia and most of the biodiesel productions are usually
  using a single strain. Then, although they are rich of oils, their biomass productivity
  is still low. Salinity treatment can be used to increase their biomass as well as
  their lipid content. Therefore, the research aim was to study the effect of salinity
  on the growth, dry weight and lipid content of mixed microalgae isolated from Glagah,
  Yogyakarta. The mixed microalgae were cultured in 3NBBM medium with different salinities
  or types of water (sea water, brackish water, and fresh water). The cultures were
  incubated at light intensity 3,000 lux under dark: light exposure of 12: 12 h for
  7 days. The number of cells was counted every 24 h with a Haemocytometer, and the
  biomass was calculated based on the dry weight. The lipid content was measured on
  days 0, 3, and 7 using NR (Nile Red) staining, and then the amount of lipid was
  analyzed using a fluorescence microscope and measured with CellProfiler 2.0 software.
  The highest dry weight and lipid content were found in seawater medium, they accounted
  for 3.42 mg/mL and 13.58% at day 7, respectively. Whereas, the highest number of
  cells was found in freshwater medium, this was 9.8Ã— 106 cells/mL.'
