 abstract = {Microalgae use photosynthesis to convert solar energy into
chemical energy, such as lipid and they can be a replacement
for oil-based fuels. They are among the fastest growing plants
in the world, and about 50% of their weight is oil. This
lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel. Unfortunately, there
are only some of potential strains isolated from Indonesia and
most of the biodiesel productions are usually using a single
strain. Then, although they are rich of oils, their biomass
productivity is still low. Salinity treatment can be used to
increase their biomass as well as their lipid content.
Therefore, the research aim was to study the effect of
salinity on the growth, dry weight and lipid content of mixed
microalgae isolated from Glagah, Yogyakarta. The mixed
microalgae were cultured in 3NBBM medium with different
salinities or types of water (sea water, brackish water, and
fresh water). The cultures were incubated at light intensity
3,000 lux under dark: light exposure of 12: 12 h for 7 days.
The number of cells was counted every 24 h with a
Haemocytometer, and the biomass was calculated based on the
dry weight. The lipid content was measured on days 0, 3, and 7
using NR (Nile Red) staining, and then the amount of lipid was
analyzed using a fluorescence microscope and measured with
CellProfiler 2.0 software. The highest dry weight and lipid
content were found in seawater medium, they accounted for 3.42
mg/mL and 13.58% at day 7, respectively. Whereas, the highest
number of cells was found in freshwater medium, this was 9.8Ã—
106 cells/mL.},
