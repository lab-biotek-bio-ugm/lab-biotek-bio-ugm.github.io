 abstract = {In this communication, we report important preliminary
evidence for possibly the toughest egg case silk threads
recorded to date spun by the hermit spider, Nephilengys
cruentata (GÂ¯=193MJm(-3)). We further elucidate that the egg
case itself is woven with a specialised repeat cross-weave
that when subjected to tension, drives perpendicular-to-force
threads to pile. This piling of threads constrains damage to
small areas and retains the architectural integrity of the
surrounding egg case material. We deduce that by having
ultra-tough threads coupled to a tear resistant architecture,
N. cruentata is able to protect its eggs from predators with a
considerable level of effectiveness.},
