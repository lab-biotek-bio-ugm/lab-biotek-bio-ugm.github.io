abstract: In this communication, we report important preliminary evidence for possibly
  the toughest egg case silk threads recorded to date spun by the hermit spider, Nephilengys
  cruentata (GÂ¯=193MJm(-3)). We further elucidate that the egg case itself is woven
  with a specialised repeat cross-weave that when subjected to tension, drives perpendicular-to-force
  threads to pile. This piling of threads constrains damage to small areas and retains
  the architectural integrity of the surrounding egg case material. We deduce that
  by having ultra-tough threads coupled to a tear resistant architecture, N. cruentata
  is able to protect its eggs from predators with a considerable level of effectiveness.
