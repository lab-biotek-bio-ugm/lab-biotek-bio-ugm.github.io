 abstract = {Secondary metabolites are compounds not essential for an
organism's development, but provide significant ecological and
physiological benefits. These compounds have applications in
medicine, biotechnology and agriculture. Their production is
encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes
collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of
metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly
from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously
unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we
present the BGC Atlas (https://bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de),
a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis
of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and
clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a
centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware
exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We
analyzed over 35 000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly
1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis
showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally
modified peptides are the most abundant compound class, with
most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We
believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily
explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental
samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of
bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the
identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping
the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.},
