 abstract = {Genome mining is revolutionizing natural products discovery
efforts. The rapid increase in available genomes demands
comprehensive computational platforms to effectively extract
biosynthetic knowledge encoded across bacterial pangenomes.
Here, we present BGCFlow, a novel systematic workflow
integrating analytics for large-scale genome mining of
bacterial pangenomes. BGCFlow incorporates several genome
analytics and mining tools grouped into five common stages of
analysis such as: (i) data selection, (ii) functional
annotation, (iii) phylogenetic analysis, (iv) genome mining,
and (v) comparative analysis. Furthermore, BGCFlow provides
easy configuration of different projects, parallel
distribution, scheduled job monitoring, an interactive
database to visualize tables, exploratory Jupyter Notebooks,
and customized reports. Here, we demonstrate the application
of BGCFlow by investigating the phylogenetic distribution of
various biosynthetic gene clusters detected across 42 genomes
of the Saccharopolyspora genus, known to produce industrially
important secondary/specialized metabolites. The
BGCFlow-guided analysis predicted more accurate dereplication
of BGCs and guided the targeted comparative analysis of
selected RiPPs. The scalable, interoperable, adaptable,
re-entrant, and reproducible nature of the BGCFlow will
provide an effective novel way to extract the biosynthetic
knowledge from the ever-growing genomic datasets of
biotechnologically relevant bacterial species.},
