 abstract = {This study showcases 121 new genomes of spore-forming
Bacillales from strains collected globally from a variety of
habitats, assembled using Oxford Nanopore long-read and MGI
short-read sequences. Bacilli are renowned for their capacity
to produce diverse secondary metabolites with use in
agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine. These secondary
metabolites are encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters
(smBGCs). smBGCs have significant research interest due to
their potential as sources of new bioactivate compounds. Our
dataset includes 62 complete genomes, 2 at chromosome level,
and 57 at contig level, covering a genomic size range from
3.50 Mb to 7.15 Mb. Phylotaxonomic analysis revealed that
these genomes span 16 genera, with 69 of them belonging to
Bacillus. A total of 1,176 predicted BGCs were identified by
in silico genome mining. We anticipate that the open-access
data presented here will expand the reported genomic
information of spore-forming Bacillales and facilitate a
deeper understanding of the genetic basis of Bacillales'
potential for secondary metabolite production.},
