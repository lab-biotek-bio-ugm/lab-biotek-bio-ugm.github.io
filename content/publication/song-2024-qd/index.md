abstract: This study showcases 121 new genomes of spore-forming Bacillales from strains
  collected globally from a variety of habitats, assembled using Oxford Nanopore long-read
  and MGI short-read sequences. Bacilli are renowned for their capacity to produce
  diverse secondary metabolites with use in agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine.
  These secondary metabolites are encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs).
  smBGCs have significant research interest due to their potential as sources of new
  bioactivate compounds. Our dataset includes 62 complete genomes, 2 at chromosome
  level, and 57 at contig level, covering a genomic size range from 3.50 Mb to 7.15
  Mb. Phylotaxonomic analysis revealed that these genomes span 16 genera, with 69
  of them belonging to Bacillus. A total of 1,176 predicted BGCs were identified by
  in silico genome mining. We anticipate that the open-access data presented here
  will expand the reported genomic information of spore-forming Bacillales and facilitate
  a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of Bacillales' potential for secondary
  metabolite production.
