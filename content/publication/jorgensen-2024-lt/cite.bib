 abstract = {Filamentous Actinobacteria, recently renamed Actinomycetia,
are the most prolific source of microbial bioactive natural
products. Studies on biosynthetic gene clusters benefit from
or require chromosome-level assemblies. Here, we provide DNA
sequences from >1000 isolates: 881 complete genomes and 153
near-complete genomes, representing 28 genera and 389 species,
including 244 likely novel species. All genomes are from
filamentous isolates of the class Actinomycetia from the NBC
culture collection. The largest genus is Streptomyces with 886
genomes including 742 complete assemblies. We use this data to
show that analysis of complete genomes can bring biological
understanding not previously derived from more fragmented
sequences or less systematic datasets. We document the central
and structured location of core genes and distal location of
specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and
duplicate core genes on the linear Streptomyces chromosome,
and analyze the content and length of the terminal inverted
repeats which are characteristic for Streptomyces. We then
analyze the diversity of trans-AT polyketide synthase
biosynthetic gene clusters, which encodes the machinery of a
biotechnologically highly interesting compound class. These
insights have both ecological and biotechnological
implications in understanding the importance of high quality
genomic resources and the complex role synteny plays in
Actinomycetia biology.},
