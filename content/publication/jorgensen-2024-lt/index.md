abstract: 'Filamentous Actinobacteria, recently renamed Actinomycetia, are the most
  prolific source of microbial bioactive natural products. Studies on biosynthetic
  gene clusters benefit from or require chromosome-level assemblies. Here, we provide
  DNA sequences from >1000 isolates: 881 complete genomes and 153 near-complete genomes,
  representing 28 genera and 389 species, including 244 likely novel species. All
  genomes are from filamentous isolates of the class Actinomycetia from the NBC culture
  collection. The largest genus is Streptomyces with 886 genomes including 742 complete
  assemblies. We use this data to show that analysis of complete genomes can bring
  biological understanding not previously derived from more fragmented sequences or
  less systematic datasets. We document the central and structured location of core
  genes and distal location of specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and
  duplicate core genes on the linear Streptomyces chromosome, and analyze the content
  and length of the terminal inverted repeats which are characteristic for Streptomyces.
  We then analyze the diversity of trans-AT polyketide synthase biosynthetic gene
  clusters, which encodes the machinery of a biotechnologically highly interesting
  compound class. These insights have both ecological and biotechnological implications
  in understanding the importance of high quality genomic resources and the complex
  role synteny plays in Actinomycetia biology.'
