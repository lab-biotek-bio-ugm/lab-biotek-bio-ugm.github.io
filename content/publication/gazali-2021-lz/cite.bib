 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Monitoring the spread of the G614 in specific
locations is critical as this variant is highly transmissible
and can trigger the emergence of other mutations. Therefore, a
rapid and accurate method that can reliably detect the D614G
mutation will be beneficial. This study aims to analyze the
potential use of the two-step Reverse Transcriptase
quantitative polymerase chain reaction - high resolution
melting analysis (RT-qPCR-HRM) to detect a specific mutation
in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples
were synthesized into cDNA and analyzed with the qPCR-HRM
method in order to detect the D614G mutation in Spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2. The primers are designed to target the specific
Spike region containing the D614G mutation. The qPCR-HRM
analysis was conducted simultaneously, and the identification
of the SARS-CoV-2 variant was confirmed by conventional PCR
and Sanger sequencing methods. RESULTS: The results showed
that the melting temperature (Tm) of the D614 variant was
79.39 ± 0.03 °C, which was slightly lower than the Tm of the
G614 variant (79.62 ± 0.015 °C). The results of the HRM
analysis, visualized by the normalized melting curve and the
difference curve were able to discriminate the D614 and G614
variant samples. All samples were identified as G614 variants
by qPCR-HRM assay, which was subsequently confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a sensitive
method that can identify the D614G mutation by a simple
two-step RT-qPCR-HRM assay procedure analysis, which can be
useful for active surveillance of the transmission of a
specific mutation.},
