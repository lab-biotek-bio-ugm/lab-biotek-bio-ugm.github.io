 abstract = {Dengue fever is caused by the mosquito-borne virus termed
(DENV). However, DENV-2 has been identified as the most
prevalent amongst the Indonesian pediatric urban population,
in contrast with the other four serotypes. Therefore, it is
important to reduce severe infection risk by adopting
preventive measures, including through vaccine development.
The aim of this study, therefore is to use various in silico
tools in the design of epitope-based peptide vaccines (T-cell
and B-cell types), based on the DENV-2 envelope glycoprotein
sequences available. Therefore, in silico methods were adopted
in the analysis of the retrieved protein sequences. This
technique was required to determine the most immunogenic
protein, and is achieved through conservancy analysis, epitope
identification, molecular simulation, and allergenicity
assessment. Furthermore, B4XPM1, and KAWLVHRQW were identified
from positions 204 â€¦},
