abstract: Dengue fever is caused by the mosquito-borne virus termed (DENV). However,
  DENV-2 has been identified as the most prevalent amongst the Indonesian pediatric
  urban population, in contrast with the other four serotypes. Therefore, it is important
  to reduce severe infection risk by adopting preventive measures, including through
  vaccine development. The aim of this study, therefore is to use various in silico
  tools in the design of epitope-based peptide vaccines (T-cell and B-cell types),
  based on the DENV-2 envelope glycoprotein sequences available. Therefore, in silico
  methods were adopted in the analysis of the retrieved protein sequences. This technique
  was required to determine the most immunogenic protein, and is achieved through
  conservancy analysis, epitope identification, molecular simulation, and allergenicity
  assessment. Furthermore, B4XPM1, and KAWLVHRQW were identified from positions 204
  â€¦
