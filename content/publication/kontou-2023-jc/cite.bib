 abstract = {Metabolomics experiments generate highly complex datasets,
which are time and work-intensive, sometimes even error-prone
if inspected manually. Therefore, new methods for automated,
fast, reproducible, and accurate data processing and
dereplication are required. Here, we present UmetaFlow, a
computational workflow for untargeted metabolomics that
combines algorithms for data pre-processing, spectral
matching, molecular formula and structural predictions, and an
integration to the GNPS workflows Feature-Based Molecular
Networking and Ion Identity Molecular Networking for
downstream analysis. UmetaFlow is implemented as a Snakemake
workflow, making it easy to use, scalable, and reproducible.
For more interactive computing, visualization, as well as
development, the workflow is also implemented in Jupyter
notebooks using the Python programming language and a set of
Python bindings to the OpenMS algorithms (pyOpenMS). Finally,
UmetaFlow is also offered as a web-based Graphical User
Interface for parameter optimization and processing of
smaller-sized datasets. UmetaFlow was validated with in-house
LC-MS/MS datasets of actinomycetes producing known secondary
metabolites, as well as commercial standards, and it detected
all expected features and accurately annotated 76% of the
molecular formulas and 65% of the structures. As a more
generic validation, the publicly available MTBLS733 and
MTBLS736 datasets were used for benchmarking, and UmetaFlow
detected more than 90% of all ground truth features and
performed exceptionally well in quantification and
discriminating marker selection. We anticipate that UmetaFlow
will provide a useful platform for the interpretation of large
metabolomics datasets.},
