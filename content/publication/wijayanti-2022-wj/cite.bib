 abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
is a new virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The
emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to the
possibility of evolutionary dynamics in the furin cleavage
site (FCS) region. This study aimed to analyze the sequence of
the FCS region in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 isolates
that circulated in the Special Region of Yogyakarta and
Central Java provinces in Indonesia. The RNA solution
extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples of confirmed
COVID-19 patients were used and subjected to cDNA synthesis,
PCR amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the FCS region.
The sequence data from GISAID were also retrieved for further
genome analysis. This study included 52 FCS region sequences.
Several mutations were identified in the FCS region, i.e.,
D614G, Q675H, Q677H, S680P, and silent mutation in 235.57 C >
T. The most important mutation in the FCS region is D614G.
This finding indicated the G614 variant was circulating from
May 2020 in those two provinces. Eventually, the G614 variant
totally replaced the D614 variant from September 2020. All
Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates during this study and those
deposited in GISAID showed the formation of five clade
clusters from the FCS region, in which the D614 variant is in
one specific cluster, and the G614 variant is dispersed into
four clusters. The data indicated there is evolutionary
advantage of the D614G mutation in the FCS region of the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the Special Region of
Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces in Indonesia.},
