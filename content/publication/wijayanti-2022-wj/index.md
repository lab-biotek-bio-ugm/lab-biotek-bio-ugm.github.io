abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus
  responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 has been
  attributed to the possibility of evolutionary dynamics in the furin cleavage site
  (FCS) region. This study aimed to analyze the sequence of the FCS region in the
  spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 isolates that circulated in the Special Region of Yogyakarta
  and Central Java provinces in Indonesia. The RNA solution extracted from nasopharyngeal
  swab samples of confirmed COVID-19 patients were used and subjected to cDNA synthesis,
  PCR amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the FCS region. The sequence data
  from GISAID were also retrieved for further genome analysis. This study included
  52 FCS region sequences. Several mutations were identified in the FCS region, i.e.,
  D614G, Q675H, Q677H, S680P, and silent mutation in 235.57 C > T. The most important
  mutation in the FCS region is D614G. This finding indicated the G614 variant was
  circulating from May 2020 in those two provinces. Eventually, the G614 variant totally
  replaced the D614 variant from September 2020. All Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates
  during this study and those deposited in GISAID showed the formation of five clade
  clusters from the FCS region, in which the D614 variant is in one specific cluster,
  and the G614 variant is dispersed into four clusters. The data indicated there is
  evolutionary advantage of the D614G mutation in the FCS region of the spike protein
  of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the Special Region of Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces
  in Indonesia.
