abstract: Human skin microbiome profile is affected by many factors including geographical
  location, environment, behaviour, and genetics. To understand more about the distribution
  of human skin microbiome across the globe, skin microbiome studies available in
  the EBI metagenomics database were compared. Based on the RESTful API of the database,
  we demonstrate programmatic access to obtain study and sample information based
  its respective metadata such as sex, geographical location, and body site. The biological
  observation matrix (BIOM) from the analysis result of the selected samples was compared
  using MEGAN Community Edition. Of the 7 studies found, comparative study was conducted
  for scalp samples between the USA and Brazilian populations, and foot samples between
  the USA and Australian populations. Data mining of the BIOM files using PCoA and
  biplot analysis showed the difference in microbiome profile between studies. Co-occurrence
  network analysis showed a major difference between scalp sample of the USA and Brazilian
  population due to the difference in microbiome richness and abundance. Foot samples
  between the USA and Australian samples, even though different in profiles, suggest
  a similar pattern in the network of bacterial interaction.
