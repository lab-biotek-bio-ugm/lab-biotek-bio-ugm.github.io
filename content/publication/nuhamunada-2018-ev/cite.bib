 abstract = {Human skin microbiome profile is affected by many factors
including geographical location, environment, behaviour, and
genetics. To understand more about the distribution of human
skin microbiome across the globe, skin microbiome studies
available in the EBI metagenomics database were compared. Based
on the RESTful API of the database, we demonstrate programmatic
access to obtain study and sample information based its
respective metadata such as sex, geographical location, and body
site. The biological observation matrix (BIOM) from the analysis
result of the selected samples was compared using MEGAN
Community Edition. Of the 7 studies found, comparative study was
conducted for scalp samples between the USA and Brazilian
populations, and foot samples between the USA and Australian
populations. Data mining of the BIOM files using PCoA and biplot
analysis showed the difference in microbiome profile between
studies. Co-occurrence network analysis showed a major
difference between scalp sample of the USA and Brazilian
population due to the difference in microbiome richness and
abundance. Foot samples between the USA and Australian samples,
even though different in profiles, suggest a similar pattern in
the network of bacterial interaction.},
