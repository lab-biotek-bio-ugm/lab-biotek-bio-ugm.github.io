 abstract = {Microorganisms produce a wide variety of secondary/specialized
metabolites (SMs), the majority of which are yet to be
discovered. These natural products play multiple roles in
microbiomes and are important for microbial competition,
communication, and success in the environment. SMs have been
our major source of antibiotics and are used in a range of
biotechnological applications. In silico mining for
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of
SMs is commonly used to assess the genetic potential of
organisms. However, as BGCs span tens to over 200 kb,
identifying complete BGCs requires genome data that has
minimal assembly gaps within the BGCs, a prerequisite that was
previously only met by individually sequenced genomes. Here,
we assess the performance of the currently available genome
mining platform antiSMASH on 1,080 high-quality
metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes (HQ MAGs) previously
produced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using a
combination of long-read (Oxford Nanopore) and short-read
(Illumina) sequencing technologies. More than 4,200 different
BGCs were identified, with 88% of these being complete.
Sequence similarity clustering of the BGCs implies that the
majority of this biosynthetic potential likely encodes novel
compounds, and few BGCs are shared between genera. We identify
BGCs in abundant and functionally relevant genera in WWTPs,
suggesting a role of secondary metabolism in this ecosystem.
We find that the assembly of HQ MAGs using long-read
sequencing is vital to explore the genetic potential for SM
production among the uncultured members of microbial
communities.},
