 abstract = {The genus Paenibacillusis a prolific producer of
secondary metabolites with diverse ecological and industrial
applications. However, a comprehensive overview of the
biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) diversity and distribution
throughout the genus has been limited. Here, we performed
large-scale genome mining on 284 high-quality genomes and
generated a non-redundant dataset of 126 representative
genomes to explore the biosynthetic potential of this genus. A
total of 3,273 BGCs were identified from the 284 genomes that
clustered into 1,013 gene cluster families (GCFs), with 98.7%
classified as unknown, indicating vast potential for novel
secondary metabolite discovery in thePaenibacillusgenus.
Comparative analysis revealed significant phylogenetic and
clade-specific distribution patterns of GCFs, with certain
clades enriched in unique biosynthetic pathways while others
exhibited low similarity to known BGCs, suggesting
evolutionary adaptation to diverse ecological niches. This
study uncovers the rich and largely untapped biosynthetic
potential of the genusPaenibacillus, providing a foundation
for future exploration of its natural products and their
applications in biotechnology and medicine.IMPORTANCEBacterial
secondary metabolites have been instrumental in the
development of antibiotics, antifungals, and other bioactive
compounds. The genusPaenibacillusis an underexplored source of
such metabolites, with significant potential for novel
discoveries. By integrating genome mining and phylogenetic
analysis, this study systematically characterizes the
diversity, distribution, and novelty of biosynthetic gene
cluster across the genus. The identification of clade-specific
biosynthetic patterns and numerous unknown gene cluster
families highlightsPaenibacillusas a promising target for
uncovering novel compounds with ecological and therapeutic
relevance. These findings not only expand our understanding of
bacterial secondary metabolite biosynthesis but also offer new
opportunities for the development of sustainable
biotechnological applications.},
