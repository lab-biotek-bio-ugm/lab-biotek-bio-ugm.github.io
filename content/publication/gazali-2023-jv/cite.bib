 abstract = {D614G mutation plays a significant role in the
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of other
mutations related to D614G mutation within the Spike protein
is pivotal as they might contribute to the pathogenicity of
SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to analyze the mutation rate of
furin cleavage site (FCS) region of Indonesian origin
SARS-CoV-2 and to predict the effect of mutation against Spike
priming efficiency by furin. A total of 375 sequences of
Indonesian isolates obtained during the early pandemic were
used for mutation analysis. Mutation analysis includes
mutation pattern, variability, frequency of mutation, amino
acid conservation, and mutation rate. The effect of mutation
against Spike priming efficiency by furin protease from eight
sequences with mutation in the FCS region was analyzed by
protein-protein docking. We showed that mutations related to
the G614 variant were increasing through time, in contrast to
the D614 variant. The FCS region at the position 675-692
contained the most variable (66.67%) as well as the highest
mutation frequency (85.92%) and has been observed to be the
hotspot mutations linked to the D614G mutation. The D614G
hotspot-FCS region (residue 600-700) had the highest amino
acid change per site (20.8%) as well as the highest mutation
rate as 1.34 × 10-2 substitution per site per year (95% CI
1.79 × 10-3-2.74 × 10-2), compared with other Spike protein
regions. Mutations in the FCS region were the most common
mutation found after the D614G mutation. These mutations were
predicted to increase the Spike priming efficiency by furin.
Thus, this study elucidates the importance of D614G mutation
to other mutations located in the FCS region and their
significance to Spike priming efficiency by furin.},
