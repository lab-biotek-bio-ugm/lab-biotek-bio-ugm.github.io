abstract: D614G mutation plays a significant role in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.
  Identification of other mutations related to D614G mutation within the Spike protein
  is pivotal as they might contribute to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. This study
  aims to analyze the mutation rate of furin cleavage site (FCS) region of Indonesian
  origin SARS-CoV-2 and to predict the effect of mutation against Spike priming efficiency
  by furin. A total of 375 sequences of Indonesian isolates obtained during the early
  pandemic were used for mutation analysis. Mutation analysis includes mutation pattern,
  variability, frequency of mutation, amino acid conservation, and mutation rate.
  The effect of mutation against Spike priming efficiency by furin protease from eight
  sequences with mutation in the FCS region was analyzed by protein-protein docking.
  We showed that mutations related to the G614 variant were increasing through time,
  in contrast to the D614 variant. The FCS region at the position 675-692 contained
  the most variable (66.67%) as well as the highest mutation frequency (85.92%) and
  has been observed to be the hotspot mutations linked to the D614G mutation. The
  D614G hotspot-FCS region (residue 600-700) had the highest amino acid change per
  site (20.8%) as well as the highest mutation rate as 1.34 × 10-2 substitution per
  site per year (95% CI 1.79 × 10-3-2.74 × 10-2), compared with other Spike protein
  regions. Mutations in the FCS region were the most common mutation found after the
  D614G mutation. These mutations were predicted to increase the Spike priming efficiency
  by furin. Thus, this study elucidates the importance of D614G mutation to other
  mutations located in the FCS region and their significance to Spike priming efficiency
  by furin.
