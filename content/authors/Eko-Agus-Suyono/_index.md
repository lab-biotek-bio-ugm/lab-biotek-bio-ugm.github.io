Dr. Eko Agus Suyono is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Biology, Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), specializing in algal biotechnology and sustainable energy. He obtained his master’s degree in Marine and Tropical Biology from James Cook University, Australia (2004), and completed his doctoral studies through a sandwich program between UGM and Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden (2013). His research focuses on algae culture and engineering for biofuel production, biomaterials derived from diatoms, and microalgae-based active compounds. 

He holds multiple national patents in the fields of algal biorefinery, cultivation techniques, and biotechnology training modules. Dr. Suyono has been actively involved in academic leadership at UGM, serving as Vice Dean for Research, Community Service, Collaboration, and Alumni since 2016. Beyond academia, he is the founder and commissioner of Micro Life Technology, and has contributed to national energy initiatives such as the Indonesia–Sweden Energy Initiative. He is also active in professional societies including the Indonesian Aquaculture Society and the Indonesian Biology Association.
