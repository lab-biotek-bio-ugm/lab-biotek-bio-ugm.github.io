Matin Nuhamunada received his BSc degree in biology in 2014 from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He finished his MSc degree in synthetic biology and biotechnology in 2016 from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, UK. Matin was awarded the Copenhagen Bioscience PhD fellowship from the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) in 2020, where he did his PhD in bioinformatics under the supervision of Prof. Tilmann Weber at the NNF Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark (DTU Biosustain). During his PhD, he visited Nadine Ziemert's group in the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany, where he contributed to the development of BGC Atlas under the supervision of Caner Bagci. Matin obtained his PhD in 2024 and after a short postdoctoral research at the same group, Matin continues his position as a junior faculty member at the Faculty of Biology, Universitas Gadjah Mada in 2025.

During his time at DTU Biosustain, Matin has co-authored 6 papers, with his main work includes the development of BGCFlow, an integrated workflow for performing large-scale genome mining of biosynthetic gene clusters. Matin was awarded best poster at the NNF Data Science for Planetary and Human Health symposium for his work in developing BGCFlow and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to interact with the local antiSMASH database.

During his MSc studies, Matin participated in the overgraduate team for the 2016 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition in Boston, US, where his team was awarded a silver medal. Matin was involved in mentoring and supervising the undergraduate iGEM team from UGM, where they were awarded a gold medal in 2021 and 2023. Matin has also received several awards and grants, such as the LPDP Scholarship, ITSF Research Grant, DIPI Small Research Grant. Matin is also an advisory board member of the synbio.id community.
