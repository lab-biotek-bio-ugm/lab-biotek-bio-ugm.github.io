  abstract     = {The genus Paenibacillusis a prolific producer of
                  secondary metabolites with diverse ecological and industrial
                  applications. However, a comprehensive overview of the
                  biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) diversity and distribution
                  throughout the genus has been limited. Here, we performed
                  large-scale genome mining on 284 high-quality genomes and
                  generated a non-redundant dataset of 126 representative
                  genomes to explore the biosynthetic potential of this genus. A
                  total of 3,273 BGCs were identified from the 284 genomes that
                  clustered into 1,013 gene cluster families (GCFs), with 98.7\%
                  classified as unknown, indicating vast potential for novel
                  secondary metabolite discovery in thePaenibacillusgenus.
                  Comparative analysis revealed significant phylogenetic and
                  clade-specific distribution patterns of GCFs, with certain
                  clades enriched in unique biosynthetic pathways while others
                  exhibited low similarity to known BGCs, suggesting
                  evolutionary adaptation to diverse ecological niches. This
                  study uncovers the rich and largely untapped biosynthetic
                  potential of the genusPaenibacillus, providing a foundation
                  for future exploration of its natural products and their
                  applications in biotechnology and medicine.IMPORTANCEBacterial
                  secondary metabolites have been instrumental in the
                  development of antibiotics, antifungals, and other bioactive
                  compounds. The genusPaenibacillusis an underexplored source of
                  such metabolites, with significant potential for novel
                  discoveries. By integrating genome mining and phylogenetic
                  analysis, this study systematically characterizes the
                  diversity, distribution, and novelty of biosynthetic gene
                  cluster across the genus. The identification of clade-specific
                  biosynthetic patterns and numerous unknown gene cluster
                  families highlightsPaenibacillusas a promising target for
                  uncovering novel compounds with ecological and therapeutic
                  relevance. These findings not only expand our understanding of
                  bacterial secondary metabolite biosynthesis but also offer new
                  opportunities for the development of sustainable

                  organism's development, but provide significant ecological and
                  physiological benefits. These compounds have applications in
                  medicine, biotechnology and agriculture. Their production is
                  encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes
                  collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of
                  metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly
                  from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously
                  unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we
                  present the BGC Atlas (https://bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de),
                  a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis
                  of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and
                  clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a
                  centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware
                  exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We
                  analyzed over 35 000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly
                  1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis
                  showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally
                  modified peptides are the most abundant compound class, with
                  most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We

                  samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of
                  bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the

                  is pivotal as they might contribute to the pathogenicity of

                  SARS-CoV-2 and to predict the effect of mutation against Spike

                  Indonesian isolates obtained during the early pandemic were

                  against Spike priming efficiency by furin protease from eight
                  sequences with mutation in the FCS region was analyzed by
                  protein-protein docking. We showed that mutations related to
                  the G614 variant were increasing through time, in contrast to
                  the D614 variant. The FCS region at the position 675-692
                  contained the most variable (66.67\%) as well as the highest
                  mutation frequency (85.92\%) and has been observed to be the
                  hotspot mutations linked to the D614G mutation. The D614G
                  hotspot-FCS region (residue 600-700) had the highest amino
                  acid change per site (20.8\%) as well as the highest mutation
                  rate as 1.34 × 10-2 substitution per site per year (95\% CI
                  1.79 × 10-3-2.74 × 10-2), compared with other Spike protein
                  regions. Mutations in the FCS region were the most common
                  mutation found after the D614G mutation. These mutations were
                  predicted to increase the Spike priming efficiency by furin.

                  D614G, Q675H, Q677H, S680P, and silent mutation in 235.57 C >
                  T. The most important mutation in the FCS region is D614G.
                  This finding indicated the G614 variant was circulating from
                  May 2020 in those two provinces. Eventually, the G614 variant
                  totally replaced the D614 variant from September 2020. All
                  Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates during this study and those
                  deposited in GISAID showed the formation of five clade
                  clusters from the FCS region, in which the D614 variant is in
                  one specific cluster, and the G614 variant is dispersed into
                  four clusters. The data indicated there is evolutionary
                  advantage of the D614G mutation in the FCS region of the spike
                  protein of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the Special Region of
                  Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces in Indonesia.},

                  which are time and work-intensive, sometimes even error-prone
                  if inspected manually. Therefore, new methods for automated,
                  fast, reproducible, and accurate data processing and
                  dereplication are required. Here, we present UmetaFlow, a
                  computational workflow for untargeted metabolomics that
                  combines algorithms for data pre-processing, spectral
                  matching, molecular formula and structural predictions, and an
                  integration to the GNPS workflows Feature-Based Molecular
                  Networking and Ion Identity Molecular Networking for
                  downstream analysis. UmetaFlow is implemented as a Snakemake
                  workflow, making it easy to use, scalable, and reproducible.
                  For more interactive computing, visualization, as well as
                  development, the workflow is also implemented in Jupyter
                  notebooks using the Python programming language and a set of
                  Python bindings to the OpenMS algorithms (pyOpenMS). Finally,
                  UmetaFlow is also offered as a web-based Graphical User
                  Interface for parameter optimization and processing of
                  smaller-sized datasets. UmetaFlow was validated with in-house
                  LC-MS/MS datasets of actinomycetes producing known secondary
                  metabolites, as well as commercial standards, and it detected
                  all expected features and accurately annotated 76\% of the
                  molecular formulas and 65\% of the structures. As a more
                  generic validation, the publicly available MTBLS733 and
                  MTBLS736 datasets were used for benchmarking, and UmetaFlow
                  detected more than 90\% of all ground truth features and
                  performed exceptionally well in quantification and
                  discriminating marker selection. We anticipate that UmetaFlow

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: Monitoring the spread of the G614 in specific
                  locations is critical as this variant is highly transmissible
                  and can trigger the emergence of other mutations. Therefore, a
                  rapid and accurate method that can reliably detect the D614G
                  mutation will be beneficial. This study aims to analyze the
                  potential use of the two-step Reverse Transcriptase
                  quantitative polymerase chain reaction - high resolution
                  melting analysis (RT-qPCR-HRM) to detect a specific mutation
                  in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples
                  were synthesized into cDNA and analyzed with the qPCR-HRM
                  method in order to detect the D614G mutation in Spike protein
                  of SARS-CoV-2. The primers are designed to target the specific
                  Spike region containing the D614G mutation. The qPCR-HRM
                  analysis was conducted simultaneously, and the identification
                  of the SARS-CoV-2 variant was confirmed by conventional PCR
                  and Sanger sequencing methods. RESULTS: The results showed
                  that the melting temperature (Tm) of the D614 variant was
                  79.39 ± 0.03 °C, which was slightly lower than the Tm of the
                  G614 variant (79.62 ± 0.015 °C). The results of the HRM
                  analysis, visualized by the normalized melting curve and the
                  difference curve were able to discriminate the D614 and G614
                  variant samples. All samples were identified as G614 variants
                  by qPCR-HRM assay, which was subsequently confirmed by Sanger
                  sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a sensitive
                  method that can identify the D614G mutation by a simple
                  two-step RT-qPCR-HRM assay procedure analysis, which can be
                  useful for active surveillance of the transmission of a
                  specific mutation.},

  abstract     = {Microorganisms produce a wide variety of secondary/specialized
                  metabolites (SMs), the majority of which are yet to be
                  discovered. These natural products play multiple roles in
                  microbiomes and are important for microbial competition,
                  communication, and success in the environment. SMs have been
                  our major source of antibiotics and are used in a range of
                  biotechnological applications. In silico mining for
                  biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of
                  SMs is commonly used to assess the genetic potential of
                  organisms. However, as BGCs span tens to over 200 kb,
                  identifying complete BGCs requires genome data that has
                  minimal assembly gaps within the BGCs, a prerequisite that was
                  previously only met by individually sequenced genomes. Here,
                  we assess the performance of the currently available genome
                  mining platform antiSMASH on 1,080 high-quality
                  metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes (HQ MAGs) previously
                  produced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using a
                  combination of long-read (Oxford Nanopore) and short-read
                  (Illumina) sequencing technologies. More than 4,200 different
                  BGCs were identified, with 88\% of these being complete.
                  Sequence similarity clustering of the BGCs implies that the
                  majority of this biosynthetic potential likely encodes novel
                  compounds, and few BGCs are shared between genera. We identify
                  BGCs in abundant and functionally relevant genera in WWTPs,
                  suggesting a role of secondary metabolism in this ecosystem.
                  We find that the assembly of HQ MAGs using long-read
                  sequencing is vital to explore the genetic potential for SM
                  production among the uncultured members of microbial
                  communities.},

                  in the world, and about 50\% of their weight is oil. This
                  lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel. Unfortunately, there
                  are only some of potential strains isolated from Indonesia and
                  most of the biodiesel productions are usually using a single
                  strain. Then, although they are rich of oils, their biomass

                  including 244 likely novel species. All genomes are from
                  filamentous isolates of the class Actinomycetia from the NBC
                  culture collection. The largest genus is Streptomyces with 886
                  genomes including 742 complete assemblies. We use this data to
                  show that analysis of complete genomes can bring biological
                  understanding not previously derived from more fragmented
                  sequences or less systematic datasets. We document the central
                  and structured location of core genes and distal location of
                  specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and
                  duplicate core genes on the linear Streptomyces chromosome,
                  and analyze the content and length of the terminal inverted
                  repeats which are characteristic for Streptomyces. We then
                  analyze the diversity of trans-AT polyketide synthase
                  biosynthetic gene clusters, which encodes the machinery of a
                  biotechnologically highly interesting compound class. These
                  insights have both ecological and biotechnological
                  implications in understanding the importance of high quality
                  genomic resources and the complex role synteny plays in
                  Actinomycetia biology.},
